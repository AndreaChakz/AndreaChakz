👀 I’m passionate about using our knowledge to create a better world. 
I believe that true change comes from transforming hearts and minds, inspired by the selfless love of Jesus.
🌱 I’m currently learning biotechnology, coding, and piano, and studying the word of God.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that align with these values and contribute to a more just and compassionate world.
⚡ Fun fact: I'm exploring how science and faith can work together to drive meaningful change in society.
