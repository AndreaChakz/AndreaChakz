👀 I’m passionate about using science to create a more just and equitable world, one without poverty.
🌱 I’m currently learning biotechnology, coding, and piano. I'm also reading the Bible and attending church to deepen my understanding of God, 
as I believe that true change comes from transforming hearts and minds, inspired by the selflessness of Jesus.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that align with these values and contribute to a more just and compassionate world.
⚡ Fun fact: I'm exploring how science and faith can work together to drive meaningful change in society.
